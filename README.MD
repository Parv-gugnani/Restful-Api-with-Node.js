## NOTES :

# Rest ->

Respresentational State Transfer
we can use it to transfer data routes
this is a alternative to the traditonal web page

# Restful Api ->

imagine we have the server and brower(client)
ex- we send request and get response , it dynamically rerender the page

like - google geo api
we send cornicated and get the parse response it automatically takes us to the place
this is also example of resfulapi

# Restful api are stateless backends

` it means server dont store any info it just wokr on requests

//get
//post
//delete
//patch

and by urls we send request and get response

//JSON
now we send AJAX request(http)
then we get response `

# Resful Constraints

- Client-server Architecture -> this dont care about the ui
- Stateless -> no context is stored on the server
- Cacheability -> response must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable
- layered System -> server used without the client knowing it
- uniform interface -> resrc are identified in request , transferred data is decoupled from db schema
- code on demand -> code that could be transfered
